The purpose of the following project is to create a general data acquisition system for use in sensing applications. As a proof of concept, the system will interface with a biological subject through EMG surface electrodes. The signals of interest are optic movement and hand contractions. From the analog signals, the system will sample and convert the information to digital data for further processing. Once the data is prepared, it will be sent to a host computer for long term storage and GUI display. The GUI will depict the electrical waveforms as well as note biomarkers for muscular contractions.
